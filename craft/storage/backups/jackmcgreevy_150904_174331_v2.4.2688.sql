I <em>am </em>on vacation, so this seems a fitting function for my blog.\r\n</p>\r\n<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I flew out of Dallas, Texas last night, where I stayed with my sister, father, and my grandparents. My father\'s brother and his family came to Texas as well making for a nice family reunion. Texas is not like California; each day is <em>at least</em> 80 °F and the air is thick and humid. To combat this every Texas residence and restaurant has A/C, which is on virtually 24/7 and cranked up (or down, I suppose) from 11 AM to 5 PM. For a Californian, this creates a constant dichotomy between hot and cold where comfort is short-lived. Upon going outside you are stricken by the heavy, scorching air, and you begin to sweat at around the three-minute mark. On the other hand, staying inside too long yields the inverse discomfort of feeling juuuust a little too cold. Amidst these opposing forces glorious comfort is achieved in two scenarios: the sweet relief you feel after walking in an air-conditioned facility after spending 30+ minutes in the sun and the first moments of thermal rebalancing you feel upon walking outside after hours spent inside (albeit, this relief quickly transposes back to discomfort). Nonetheless, that sort of discomfort is purely the result of having the privilege of A/C, a privilege that the majority of the globe is not afforded, and so I can\'t help but be grateful.\r\n</p>\r\n<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night my sister and I landed in Boston, Massachusetts. The city is about 45 minutes from where we\'re staying, a quaint little harbor town called Scituate. I\'m positive I\'ll be back there shortly to see the city\'s various attractions. I\'m especially excited to visit the Harvard Museum of Natural History and all its taxonomical treasures. Much to my delight, I woke up this morning to a muggy, hot discomfort reminiscent of my time in Texas. Unfortunately, my aunt and uncle\'s home is not fitted with air conditioning (I am currently lying on the bed upstairs in my underwear with an industrial-strength fan blasting on me), and I quickly began to miss the thermal rebalancing act that irked me so during my stay in Dallas. I will be staying here for two weeks, free of the distractions in Texas characterized by constant \"family-oriented\" activity, so I hope to really start plowing away at the site.\r\n</p>\r\n<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, to supplement the technical aspect of this blog, I\'ll fill in my plentiful readers with my progress. I\'ve finished the PHP track I was on and now hope to dive into the more specific aspects of its application. I\'ve just acquired a few new courses on udemy: one on jQuery functions, one on Object-Oriented Programming, and one on Javascript. I\'m tempted to immerse myself in the styling of jackmcgreevy.com, a practice I\'m familiar with and somewhat partial too, but I think it best to continue educating myself in server-side scripting and save the fun stuff for last.\r\n</p>\r\n<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus marks the end of my first blog post! It feels strange writing so much about myself, but such is the purpose of a blog. Until next time beloved readers!\r\n</p>', '<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello world, welcome to my blog.

Alas, this will come as a surprise to many but I am not dead. I am also not horribly injured. I realize that it has been many weeks since my last update. Surely this has caused a number of brooding concerns about my health, so I wanted to dispel any wild rumors circulating around. It was no malady or injury that kept me from updating my blog. No, it was negligence. Negligence brought on by the folly and whimsical nature of Summer. But as Autumn arrives, follies must be put aside. I would feel remiss, however, if I didn\'t keep my beloved followers informed of all my Summer adventures...\r\n</p><p>My visit to Massachusetts was a fulfilling one. With 7 aunts, 2 uncles, and a myriad of cousins and nephews, I was certainly kept busy. While I chiefly stayed in Scituate, a charming little harbor town, I had the pleasure of traveling all over the state. Visiting Boston was pleasant at usual, despite the awful heat that hung over the city. I got to take a cruise around the Boston Harbor and eat delicious veal in the dimly lit cellar of some authentic Italian restaurant on the North End. But it wouldn\'t be a trip to Boston without some dejecting experience with public transit...\r\n</p><p>On my last day in the city, I plotted out a visit to the Harvard Museum of Natural History using the city\'s bus system. To ensure that I wouldn\'t have any issues getting there, I left and started walking to the first bus stop 30 minutes early. It was HOT, 94°F at the sun\'s apogee, and I was drenched in sweat within the five minutes of stepping outside. I got to the bus stop twenty minutes early. The sun\'s merciless rays causing me to regret the mix of anticipation and apprehension that had convinced me it was wise to leave myself plenty of time to catch the bus. It is the same electric feeling I experience before embarking on any journey requiring the use of public transportation. Bus numbers and times and directions; the same numbers circulate through my mind. I switch back and forth between leaning against a wall and peering down the street to see if the bus is in sight. I increasingly choosing the latter, as the bus\'s arrival time grew nearer. Finally, a few minutes late, I make out my bus stopped at a light a few blocks away. Cash in hand, I eagerly step forward to the sign indicating that this was in fact a bus stop for bus #34. So imagine my surprise as the bus drives right past me and my sign and across the nearby intersection, stopping on the curb alongside a sign identical to the one I stood next to. I began sprinting across the intersection just as the light turned yellow, but this was one of those enormous crosswalks that offers pedestrians half a minute to make it across. I only managed to make it to the median before the light turned red. I was forced to watch helplessly from the middle of the road as people trickle off the bus, a few people get on, the doors swing shut, and my bus drives away. Thus ended any chance of me visiting the museum this year. I walked home feeling cross, opting to sulk on the couch and watch Keeping Up With The Kardashians for the rest of the afternoon. On the bright side, my anticipation for next year\'s visit to the museum will make its eventual completion all the more satisfying.\r\n</p><p>Cape Cod was also very beautiful. It\'s a very unique environment, one without any sort of alternative in my hometown of California. That\'s notable because California is home to practically every landscape the U.S. has to offer. Cape Cod\'s charm comes from the diverse ecosystems it supports. Ranging from highlands to dunes, meadows to salt marshes, Massachusetts\'s peninsula is full of biodiversity that all its visitors appreciate. I stayed with my childhood friend, Koby, at his family\'s Cape house for three days. He was working on the Cape over the summer at a outdoor ropes course, so I had a lot of time to myself during the mornings/afternoons over the course of my stay. Here I finished reading Pride and Prejudice, a personal favorite of mine, seated on a bench centered in the house\'s colorful garden. I also had the pleasure of visiting the Cape Cod Museum of Natural History and attending one of its nature walks. Although this certainly was not the Harvard museum I mentioned before, its whale exhibit was interesting and trails were beautiful and extensive, and I was able to satiate my urge to visit some a natural history museum while in Massachusetts. An urge I know all Americans struggle with...\r\n</p><p><img src=\"{asset:76:url}\"><br>\r\n</p><article>\r\n<p>I returned to San Jose on July 22nd, spending a week at home before leaving for another mini-vacation. My father, little sister Ally, and I drove down to Long Beach to catch a ferry to Santa Catalina. My older sister Molly had acquired a summer job on the island driving buses. This isn\'t the first time her bus driving skills have offered her the opportunity to work on an island. Last summer she drove buses on Martha\'s Vineyard, Cape Cod\'s very own island getaway. I figure next year she\'ll be driving buses in the Bahamas. Santa Catalina is absolutely incredible. Eighty percent of the island is a preserved by the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy, so the island really has just two populated towns, Avalon and Two Harbors. My sister stayed in Avalon. The island company, the entity which imported the workforce for the island\'s tourist attractions, housed all of its employees in a comfortable apartment complex (nicknamed \'Monkeytown\') for dirt-cheap rent. Tourist attractions include bus tours of the island\'s interior, the island\'s zip-line course, and the beaches with their various bars and restaurants. My father and younger sister stayed two days, but I chose to stay with my sister for the remainder of the week. I slept with her at Monkeytown, in the backyard of the male employees\' complex. A few of the guys there are rugged outdoorsish types, and one of them had a hammock struck up in back. I slept in his hammock every night, waking up each morning enamored by the island and its beauty. Every morning, I would wake up to the sun painting the face of the adjacent mountainside. Each day, I\'d get dressed and walk to town to grab a coffee. Once inn town, I\'d walk to some benches and read on the oceanfront for an hour or so. Some days, I\'d treat myself after reading and grab breakfast at this nice little cafe. Granted, everything on the island is expensive. But I decided to embrace the vacation spirit and spend shamelessly, to the injury of my car fund... I absolutely fell in love with the island and was very sad to leave it. I definitely have to visit again at some point in my life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{asset:80:url}\"><br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>I ferried back to Long Beach at 7:30 on a Friday morning. Back on the North American continent, I bused my way to LA Union Station and hopped on a train to Oceanside with the intention of visiting a good friend living further south. There, I hung around a local coffee shop and waited a few hours for my bus. My bus arrives and takes me to Temecula, CA, my destination. My buddy Steve is waiting for me at the bus stop. We head back to his place where I proceed to pass out after inhaling some dinner. Public transit is exhausting. Temecula is admittedly less glamorous than Santa Catalina, but I had a good time seeing  my buddy Steve after nine months apart. We spent the weekend playing video games and hanging out poolside, two of the few decent things to do in that town. Monday morning I began my long journey home, busing from Temecula back to Oceanside and hopping on a train from there to Santa Barbara. My friend Tommy picks me up from the station Monday evening, takes me back to his place, and we spend the evening relaxing. Tuesday afternoon and I resume my journey: Tommy takes me to the transit center where I hop on a spacious bus headed to San Fransisco. The bus stops in San Jose after 6 hours, and my dad is waiting at the station. He drops me off at home where I pass out, drained from the last two days of travel.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"{asset:77:url}\"><br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Since returning from my travels, I\'ve been transitioning back to a lifestyle geared toward productivity. No upcoming trips to look forward to, significantly less free time, and the looming responsibilities I\'ll have once I start college late September. While I will always appreciate periods of time where I have less responsibilities, I thrive with structure. Without responsibilities it is easy for one to fall into apathy. But amidst school, work, and working on bettering myself, there is no room for apathy. My attention is primarily fixed on continuing to learn about/hone my skills with Craft and Twig, but I also have begun learning about version control and Git. Sometimes, it feels like with each new software or language I attempt to add to my arsenal, ten other concepts must first be mastered. I recently ran into this experience while working on a Git Basics course on laracasts.com. While I actually enjoy working in a command-line interface, I began to stumble as the course instructor introduced the dependency manager Composer and the installation of packages; no matter what I tried, I couldn\'t produce the same output as the instructor. It\'s frustrating for me when I can\'t figure something out right away. But eventually my struggles paid off when I finally worked out the problem – the shell configuration in my system was all screwed up, thanks to my having ignorantly fiddled with my system\'s programs back when I first began working with the CLI. I consequently reconfigured my default programs and was able to continue the Git course. This accomplishment was not an important one, but a small victory. As I continue to grow and develop my skills and knowledge, I must remember to celebrate all \"victories\", be them big or small. Daunting as web development and its intricacies may at times seem, persistence, discipline, and a little bit of optimism make a world of difference.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Until next time!\r\n</p></article>', '<p>Hello my loyal followers.

Alas, this will come as a surprise to many but I am not dead. I am also not horribly injured. I realize that it has been many weeks since my last update. Surely this has caused a number of brooding concerns about my health, so I wanted to dispel any wild rumors circulating around. It was no malady or injury that kept me from updating my blog. No, it was negligence. Negligence brought on by the folly and whimsical nature of Summer. But as Autumn arrives, follies must be put aside. I would feel remiss, however, if I didn\'t keep my beloved followers informed of all my Summer adventures...\r\n</p><p>My visit to Massachusetts was a fulfilling one. With 7 aunts, 2 uncles, and a myriad of cousins and nephews, I was certainly kept busy. While I chiefly stayed in Scituate, a charming little harbor town, I had the pleasure of traveling all over the state. Visiting Boston was pleasant at usual, despite the awful heat that hung over the city. I got to take a cruise around the Boston Harbor and eat delicious veal in the dimly lit cellar of some authentic Italian restaurant on the North End. But it wouldn\'t be a trip to Boston without some dejecting experience with public transit...\r\n</p><p>On my last day in the city, I plotted out a visit to the Harvard Museum of Natural History using the city\'s bus system. To ensure that I wouldn\'t have any issues getting there, I left and started walking to the first bus stop 30 minutes early. It was HOT, 94°F at the sun\'s apogee, and I was drenched in sweat within the five minutes of stepping outside. I got to the bus stop twenty minutes early. The sun\'s merciless rays causing me to regret the mix of anticipation and apprehension that had convinced me it was wise to leave myself plenty of time to catch the bus. It is the same electric feeling I experience before embarking on any journey requiring the use of public transportation. Bus numbers and times and directions; the same numbers circulate through my mind. I switch back and forth between leaning against a wall and peering down the street to see if the bus is in sight. I increasingly choosing the latter, as the bus\'s arrival time grew nearer. Finally, a few minutes late, I make out my bus stopped at a light a few blocks away. Cash in hand, I eagerly step forward to the sign indicating that this was in fact a bus stop for bus #34. So imagine my surprise as the bus drives right past me and my sign and across the nearby intersection, stopping on the curb alongside a sign identical to the one I stood next to. I began sprinting across the intersection just as the light turned yellow, but this was one of those enormous crosswalks that offers pedestrians half a minute to make it across. I only managed to make it to the median before the light turned red. I was forced to watch helplessly from the middle of the road as people trickle off the bus, a few people get on, the doors swing shut, and my bus drives away. Thus ended any chance of me visiting the museum this year. I walked home feeling cross, opting to sulk on the couch and watch Keeping Up With The Kardashians for the rest of the afternoon. On the bright side, my anticipation for next year\'s visit to the museum will make its eventual completion all the more satisfying.\r\n</p><p>Cape Cod was also very beautiful. It\'s a very unique environment, one without any sort of alternative in my hometown of California. That\'s notable because California is home to practically every landscape the U.S. has to offer. Cape Cod\'s charm comes from the diverse ecosystems it supports. Ranging from highlands to dunes, meadows to salt marshes, Massachusetts\'s peninsula is full of biodiversity that all its visitors appreciate. I stayed with my childhood friend, Koby, at his family\'s Cape house for three days. He was working on the Cape over the summer at a outdoor ropes course, so I had a lot of time to myself during the mornings/afternoons over the course of my stay. Here I finished reading Pride and Prejudice, a personal favorite of mine, seated on a bench centered in the house\'s colorful garden. I also had the pleasure of visiting the Cape Cod Museum of Natural History and attending one of its nature walks. Although this certainly was not the Harvard museum I mentioned before, its whale exhibit was interesting and trails were beautiful and extensive, and I was able to satiate my urge to visit some a natural history museum while in Massachusetts. An urge I know all Americans struggle with...\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><p>I returned to San Jose on July 22nd, spending a week at home before leaving for another mini-vacation. My father, little sister Ally, and I drove down to Long Beach to catch a ferry to Santa Catalina. My older sister Molly had acquired a summer job on the island driving buses. This isn\'t the first time her bus driving skills have offered her the opportunity to work on an island. Last summer she drove buses on Martha\'s Vineyard, Cape Cod\'s very own island getaway. I figure next year she\'ll be driving buses in the Bahamas. Santa Catalina is absolutely incredible. Eighty percent of the island is a preserved by the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy, so the island really has just two populated towns, Avalon and Two Harbors. My sister stayed in Avalon. The island company, the entity which imported the workforce for the island\'s tourist attractions, housed all of its employees in a comfortable apartment complex (nicknamed \'Monkeytown\') for dirt-cheap rent. Tourist attractions include bus tours of the island\'s interior, the island\'s zip-line course, and the beaches with their various bars and restaurants. My father and younger sister stayed two days, but I chose to stay with my sister for the remainder of the week. I slept with her at Monkeytown, in the backyard of the male employees\' complex. A few of the guys there are rugged outdoorsish types, and one of them had a hammock struck up in back. I slept in his hammock every night, waking up each morning enamored by the island and its beauty. Every morning, I would wake up to the sun painting the face of the adjacent mountainside. Each day, I\'d get dressed and walk to town to grab a coffee. Once inn town, I\'d walk to some benches and read on the oceanfront for an hour or so. Some days, I\'d treat myself after reading and grab breakfast at this nice little cafe. Granted, everything on the island is expensive. But I decided to embrace the vacation spirit and spend shamelessly, to the injury of my car fund... I absolutely fell in love with the island and was very sad to leave it. I definitely have to visit again at some point in my life.\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><p>I ferried back to Long Beach at 7:30 on a Friday morning. Back on the North American continent, I bused my way to LA Union Station and hopped on a train to Oceanside with the intention of visiting a good friend living further south. There, I hung around a local coffee shop and waited a few hours for my bus. My bus arrives and takes me to Temecula, CA, my destination. My buddy Steve is waiting for me at the bus stop. We head back to his place where I proceed to pass out after inhaling some dinner. Public transit is exhausting. Temecula is admittedly less glamorous than Santa Catalina, but I had a good time seeing my buddy Steve after nine months apart. We spent the weekend playing video games and hanging out poolside, two of the few decent things to do in that town. Monday morning I began my long journey home, busing from Temecula back to Oceanside and hopping on a train from there to Santa Barbara. My friend Tommy picks me up from the station Monday evening, takes me back to his place, and we spend the evening relaxing. Tuesday afternoon and I resume my journey: Tommy takes me to the transit center where I hop on a spacious bus headed to San Fransisco. The bus stops in San Jose after 6 hours, and my dad is waiting at the station. He drops me off at home where I pass out, drained from the last two days of travel.\r\n</p><p><br>\r\n</p><p>Since returning from my travels, I\'ve been transitioning back to a lifestyle geared toward productivity. No upcoming trips to look forward to, significantly less free time, and the looming responsibilities I\'ll have once I start college late September. While I will always appreciate periods of time where I have less responsibilities, I thrive with structure. Without responsibilities it is easy for one to fall into apathy. But amidst school, work, and working on bettering myself, there is no room for apathy. My attention is primarily fixed on continuing to learn about/hone my skills with Craft and Twig, but I also have begun learning about version control and Git. Sometimes, it feels like with each new software or language I attempt to add to my arsenal, ten other concepts must first be mastered. I recently ran into this experience while working on a Git Basics course on laracasts.com. While I actually enjoy working in a command-line interface, I began to stumble as the course instructor introduced the dependency manager Composer and the installation of packages; no matter what I tried, I couldn\'t produce the same output as the instructor. It\'s frustrating for me when I can\'t figure something out right away. But eventually my struggles paid off when I finally worked out the problem – the shell configuration in my system was all screwed up, thanks to my having ignorantly fiddled with my system\'s programs back when I first began working with the CLI. I consequently reconfigured my default programs and was able to continue the Git course. This accomplishment was not an important one, but a small victory. As I continue to grow and develop my skills and knowledge, I must remember to celebrate all \"victories\", be them big or small. Daunting as web development and its intricacies may at times seem, persistence, discipline, and a little bit of optimism make a world of difference.\r\n</p><p>Until next time!\r\n</p>', '<p>Hello my loyal followers. Alas, this will come as a surprise to many but I am not dead. I am also not horribly injured. I realize that it has been many weeks since my last update. Surely this has caused a number of brooding concerns about my health, so I wanted to dispel any wild rumors circulating around. It was no malady or injury that kept me from updating my blog. No, it was negligence. Negligence brought on by the folly and whimsical nature of Summer. But as Autumn arrives, follies must be put aside. I would feel remiss, however, if I didn\'t keep my beloved followers informed of all my Summer adventures...</p>', NULL, '2015-08-28 19:58:42', '2015-08-31 05:51:06', '3bef9e53-3f61-45e6-a014-d3c58de16336');

I stayed there for two weeks and traveled all over the state. Visiting Boston was pleasant at usual, despite the deplorable heat that hung over the city throughout my stay. I got to take a cruise around the Boston Harbor and eat delicious veal in the dimly lit cellar of some authentic Italian restaurant on the North End. But it wouldn\'t be a trip to Boston without some dejecting experience with public transit. <\\/p><p>On my last day in the city, I plotted out a visit to the Harvard Museum of Natural History using the city\'s bus system. To ensure that I wouldn\'t have any issues getting there, I left and started walking to the first bus stop 30 minutes early. It was HOT, 94\\u00b0F at the sun\'s apogee, and I was drenched in sweat within the five minutes. I got to the bus stop twenty minutes early, the sun\'s merciless rays causing me to regret the familiar mix of anticipation and apprehension that had convinced me leaving for the stop 30 minutes in advance was a good idea. It is the same electricity I always experience before embarking on a journey requiring the use of public transportation, of multiple bus numbers and times and directions. I rotate between leaning against a wall and peering down the street to see if the bus is in sight, increasingly choosing the latter as the bus\'s arrival time grew nearer. Finally, a few minutes late, I make out my bus stopped at a light a few blocks away. Cash in hand (exact change, mind you), I eagerly step forward to the sign covered by the number 34 and a simple graphic of a bus, indicating that the adjacent sidewalk was in fact a bus stop for bus #34. So imagine my surprise as the bus drives right past me and the dubious sign and across the nearby intersection, stopping on the curb alongside a sign identical to the one I stood next to. I began sprinting across the intersection just as the light turned yellow. But this was one of those enormous crosswalks that offers pedestrians half a minute to make it across, and I only managed to make it to the median in the road before the light turned red. I was forced to watch helplessly from the middle of the road as people trickled off the bus, a few people get on, the doors swing shut, and my bus drives away. Thus ended any chance of me visiting the museum this year. I walked home feeling cross, and chose to sulk on the couch and watch Keeping Up With The Kardashians for the rest of the afternoon.<\\/p><p>Cape Cod was also very beautiful. It\'s a very unique environment, one without any sort of alternative in my hometown of California. That\'s notable, because California has a wide variety of ecologies and environments. Cape Cod\'s charm comes from the diverse ecosystems it contains. Ranging from highlands to dunes, meadows to salt marshes, Massachusetts\'s peninsula is full of biodiversity that its residents can appreciate. I stayed with my childhood friend Koby at his family\'s Cape house for a few days. He was working on the Cape over the summer at a outdoor ropes course, so I had a lot of time to myself during the mornings\\/afternoons. I finished Pride and Prejudice, a personal favorite of mine, seated on a bench amidst the garden\'s colorful array of flowers. I also had the pleasure of visiting the Cape Cod Museum of Natural History and attending one of its nature walks. Although this certainly was not the Harvard museum I mentioned before, its whale exhibit was interesting and trails were beautiful and extensive, and I was able to satiate my urge to visit some a natural history museum while in Massachusetts. Tis an urge many are familiar with... <\\/p><p>I returned to San Jose on July 22nd, spending a week at home before leaving for another mini-vacation. My father, little sister Ally, and I drove down to Long Beach to catch a ferry to Santa Catalina. My older sister Molly had acquired a summer job on the island driving buses. This isn\'t the first time her bus driving skills have offered her the opportunity to work on an island. Last summer she drove buses on Martha\'s Vineyard, Cape Cod\'s very own island get away. I figure next year she\'ll be driving buses in the Bahamas. Santa Catalina is absolutely incredible. Eighty percent of the island is a preserved by the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy, so the island really only has two populated towns, Avalon and Two Harbors. My sister lived in Avalon. The island company, the entity which imported the workforce for the island\'s tourist attractions, housed all of its employees in a comfortable apartment complex (nicknamed \'Monkeytown\') for dirt cheap rent. Tourist attractions include bus tours of the island\'s interior, the island\'s zip-line course, and the beaches with their various bars and restaurants. My father and younger sister stayed two days, but I chose to stay with my sister for the remainder of the week. I slept at Monkeytown, in the backyard of the male employees\' complex. A lot of the guys there are rugged outdoorsish types, and one of them had a hammock struck up in back. I slept in that hammock every night, enamored island and its beauty. Every morning I woke up early to the sun\'s rays painting the face of the mountainside. I\'d get dressed and walk to town to grab a coffee and read on the oceanfront for an hour or so, then grab breakfast at this nice little cafe. Granted, everything on the island is expensive. But I decided to embrace the vacation spirit and spend shamelessly (to the injury of my car fund). I absolutely fell in love with the island and was very sad to leave it. But I know that I will definitely have to visit again at some point in my life.<\\/p><p>I ferried back to Long Beach at 7:30 Friday morning. Back on the North American continent, I bused my way to LA Union Station and hopped on a train to Oceanside with the intention of visiting a good friend living further south. There, I hung around a local coffee shop and waited a few hours for my bus. My bus arrives and takes me to Temecula, CA, my destination. My buddy Steve is waiting for me at the bus stop. We head back to his place where I proceed to pass out after inhaling some dinner. Public transit is exhausting. Temecula is admittedly less glamorous than Santa Catalina, but I had a good time seeing Steve after nine months apart. We spent the weekend playing video games and hanging out poolside, two of the few decent things to do in that town. Monday morning I began my long journey home, busing from Temecula back to Oceanside and hopping on a train from there to Santa Barbara. My friend Tommy picks me up from the station Monday evening, and he takes me back to his place where we spend the evening relaxing. Tuesday afternoon and I resume my journey: Tommy takes me to the transit center where I hop on a spacious bus headed to San Fransisco. The bus stops in San Jose after 6 hours, and my dad is waiting at the station. He drops me off at home where, drained from the last two days of travel, I pass out. <\\/p><p>That was about three days ago. It feels good to be back home for the long haul. With school starting late September, I\'ve got no more vacations planned. This site will take up most of my attention now that I\'m home. I\'ll also continue to educate myself, as learning as taken a backseat this past two weeks. I hope my lovely followers can rest easy knowing exactly how I\'ve been spending my time over the last four weeks. I know my absence has been tough for many, but I assure everyone that you\'ll hear from me a lot sooner than last time.<\\/p><p>Auf Wiedersehen<span class=\\\"redactor-invisible-space\\\">!<\\/span><\\/p>\",\"2\":\"\"}}', '2015-08-14 23:13:20', '2015-08-14 23:13:20', '91ac33be-c867-4ff0-9936-52577166407e');

It is the same electric feeling I experience before embarking on any journey requiring the use of public transportation. Bus numbers and times and directions; the same numbers circulate through my mind. I switch back and forth between leaning against a wall and peering down the street to see if the bus is in sight. I increasingly choosing the latter, as the bus\'s arrival time grew nearer. Finally, a few minutes late, I make out my bus stopped at a light a few blocks away. Cash in hand, I eagerly step forward to the sign indicating that this was in fact a bus stop for bus #34. So imagine my surprise as the bus drives right past me and my sign and across the nearby intersection, stopping on the curb alongside a sign identical to the one I stood next to. I began sprinting across the intersection just as the light turned yellow, but this was one of those enormous crosswalks that offers pedestrians half a minute to make it across. I only managed to make it to the median before the light turned red. I was forced to watch helplessly from the middle of the road as people trickle off the bus, a few people get on, the doors swing shut, and my bus drives away. Thus ended any chance of me visiting the museum this year. I walked home feeling cross, opting to sulk on the couch and watch Keeping Up With The Kardashians for the rest of the afternoon.<\\/p><p>Cape Cod was also very beautiful. It\'s a very unique environment, one without any sort of alternative in my hometown of California. That\'s notable because California has practically every landscape imaginable. Cape Cod\'s charm comes from the diverse ecosystems it supports. Ranging from highlands to dunes, meadows to salt marshes, Massachusetts\'s peninsula is full of biodiversity that all its visitors appreciate. I stayed with my childhood friend, Koby, at his family\'s Cape house for three days. He was working on the Cape over the summer at a outdoor ropes course, so I had a lot of time to myself during the mornings\\/afternoons over the course of my stay. Here I finished reading Pride and Prejudice, a personal favorite of mine, seated on a bench centered in the house\'s colorful garden. I also had the pleasure of visiting the Cape Cod Museum of Natural History and attending one of its nature walks. Although this certainly was not the Harvard museum I mentioned before, its whale exhibit was interesting and trails were beautiful and extensive, and I was able to satiate my urge to visit some a natural history museum while in Massachusetts. An urge I know all Americans struggle with...<\\/p><p>I returned to San Jose on July 22nd, spending a week at home before leaving for another mini-vacation. My father, little sister Ally, and I drove down to Long Beach to catch a ferry to Santa Catalina. My older sister Molly had acquired a summer job on the island driving buses. This isn\'t the first time her bus driving skills have offered her the opportunity to work on an island. Last summer she drove buses on Martha\'s Vineyard, Cape Cod\'s very own island getaway. I figure next year she\'ll be driving buses in the Bahamas. Santa Catalina is absolutely incredible. Eighty percent of the island is a preserved by the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy, so the island really has just two populated towns, Avalon and Two Harbors. My sister stayed in Avalon. The island company, the entity which imported the workforce for the island\'s tourist attractions, housed all of its employees in a comfortable apartment complex (nicknamed \'Monkeytown\') for dirt-cheap rent. Tourist attractions include bus tours of the island\'s interior, the island\'s zip-line course, and the beaches with their various bars and restaurants. My father and younger sister stayed two days, but I chose to stay with my sister for the remainder of the week. I slept with her at Monkeytown, in the backyard of the male employees\' complex. A few of the guys there are rugged outdoorsish types, and one of them had a hammock struck up in back. I slept in his hammock every night, waking up each morning enamored by the island and its beauty. Every morning, I would wake up to the sun painting the face of the adjacent mountainside. Each day, I\'d get dressed and walk to town to grab a coffee. Once inn town, I\'d walk to some benches and read on the oceanfront for an hour or so. Some days, I\'d treat myself after reading and grab breakfast at this nice little cafe. Granted, everything on the island is expensive. But I decided to embrace the vacation spirit and spend shamelessly, to the injury of my car fund... I absolutely fell in love with the island and was very sad to leave it. I definitely have to visit again at some point in my life.<\\/p><p>I ferried back to Long Beach at 7:30 Friday morning. Back on the North American continent, I bused my way to LA Union Station and hopped on a train to Oceanside with the intention of visiting a good friend living further south. There, I hung around a local coffee shop and waited a few hours for my bus. My bus arrives and takes me to Temecula, CA, my destination. My buddy Steve is waiting for me at the bus stop. We head back to his place where I proceed to pass out after inhaling some dinner. Public transit is exhausting. Temecula is admittedly less glamorous than Santa Catalina, but I had a good time seeing  my buddy Steve after nine months apart. We spent the weekend playing video games and hanging out poolside, two of the few decent things to do in that town. Monday morning I began my long journey home, busing from Temecula back to Oceanside and hopping on a train from there to Santa Barbara. My friend Tommy picks me up from the station Monday evening, takes me back to his place, and we spend the evening relaxing. Tuesday afternoon and I resume my journey: Tommy takes me to the transit center where I hop on a spacious bus headed to San Fransisco. The bus stops in San Jose after 6 hours, and my dad is waiting at the station. He drops me off at home where I pass out, drained from the last two days of travel. <\\/p><p>That was about three days ago. It feels good to be back home for the long haul. With school starting late September, I\'ve got no more vacations planned. This site will take up most of my attention now that I\'m home. I\'ll also continue to educate myself, as learning as taken a backseat this past two weeks. I hope my lovely followers can rest easy knowing exactly how I\'ve been spending my time over the last four weeks.

I slept in his hammock every night, waking up each morning enamored by the island and its beauty. Every morning, I would wake up to the sun painting the face of the adjacent mountainside. Each day, I\'d get dressed and walk to town to grab a coffee. Once inn town, I\'d walk to some benches and read on the oceanfront for an hour or so. Some days, I\'d treat myself after reading and grab breakfast at this nice little cafe. Granted, everything on the island is expensive. But I decided to embrace the vacation spirit and spend shamelessly, to the injury of my car fund... I absolutely fell in love with the island and was very sad to leave it. I definitely have to visit again at some point in my life.<\\/p><p>I ferried back to Long Beach at 7:30 Friday morning. Back on the North American continent, I bused my way to LA Union Station and hopped on a train to Oceanside with the intention of visiting a good friend living further south. There, I hung around a local coffee shop and waited a few hours for my bus. My bus arrives and takes me to Temecula, CA, my destination. My buddy Steve is waiting for me at the bus stop. We head back to his place where I proceed to pass out after inhaling some dinner. Public transit is exhausting. Temecula is admittedly less glamorous than Santa Catalina, but I had a good time seeing  my buddy Steve after nine months apart. We spent the weekend playing video games and hanging out poolside, two of the few decent things to do in that town. Monday morning I began my long journey home, busing from Temecula back to Oceanside and hopping on a train from there to Santa Barbara. My friend Tommy picks me up from the station Monday evening, takes me back to his place, and we spend the evening relaxing. Tuesday afternoon and I resume my journey: Tommy takes me to the transit center where I hop on a spacious bus headed to San Fransisco. The bus stops in San Jose after 6 hours, and my dad is waiting at the station. He drops me off at home where I pass out, drained from the last two days of travel. <\\/p><p>That was about three days ago. It feels good to be back home for the long haul.

I stayed there for two weeks and traveled all over the state. Visiting Boston was pleasant at usual, despite the awful heat that hung over the city. I got to take a cruise around the Boston Harbor and eat delicious veal in the dimly lit cellar of some authentic Italian restaurant on the North End. But it wouldn\'t be a trip to Boston without some dejecting experience with public transit...<\\/p><p>On my last day in the city, I plotted out a visit to the Harvard Museum of Natural History using the city\'s bus system. To ensure that I wouldn\'t have any issues getting there, I left and started walking to the first bus stop 30 minutes early. It was HOT, 94\\u00b0F at the sun\'s apogee, and I was drenched in sweat within the five minutes of stepping outside. I got to the bus stop twenty minutes early. The sun\'s merciless rays causing me to regret the mix of anticipation and apprehension that had convinced me it was wise to leave myself plenty of time to catch the bus. It is the same electric feeling I experience before embarking on any journey requiring the use of public transportation. Bus numbers and times and directions; the same numbers circulate through my mind. I switch back and forth between leaning against a wall and peering down the street to see if the bus is in sight. I increasingly choosing the latter, as the bus\'s arrival time grew nearer. Finally, a few minutes late, I make out my bus stopped at a light a few blocks away. Cash in hand, I eagerly step forward to the sign indicating that this was in fact a bus stop for bus #34. So imagine my surprise as the bus drives right past me and my sign and across the nearby intersection, stopping on the curb alongside a sign identical to the one I stood next to. I began sprinting across the intersection just as the light turned yellow, but this was one of those enormous crosswalks that offers pedestrians half a minute to make it across. I only managed to make it to the median before the light turned red. I was forced to watch helplessly from the middle of the road as people trickle off the bus, a few people get on, the doors swing shut, and my bus drives away.

My father, little sister Ally, and I drove down to Long Beach to catch a ferry to Santa Catalina. My older sister Molly had acquired a summer job on the island driving buses. This isn\'t the first time her bus driving skills have offered her the opportunity to work on an island. Last summer she drove buses on Martha\'s Vineyard, Cape Cod\'s very own island getaway. I figure next year she\'ll be driving buses in the Bahamas. Santa Catalina is absolutely incredible. Eighty percent of the island is a preserved by the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy, so the island really has just two populated towns, Avalon and Two Harbors. My sister stayed in Avalon. The island company, the entity which imported the workforce for the island\'s tourist attractions, housed all of its employees in a comfortable apartment complex (nicknamed \'Monkeytown\') for dirt-cheap rent. Tourist attractions include bus tours of the island\'s interior, the island\'s zip-line course, and the beaches with their various bars and restaurants.

I stayed there for two weeks and traveled all over the state. Visiting Boston was pleasant at usual, despite the awful heat that hung over the city. I got to take a cruise around the Boston Harbor and eat delicious veal in the dimly lit cellar of some authentic Italian restaurant on the North End. But it wouldn\'t be a trip to Boston without some dejecting experience with public transit...\\r\\n<\\/p><p>On my last day in the city, I plotted out a visit to the Harvard Museum of Natural History using the city\'s bus system. To ensure that I wouldn\'t have any issues getting there, I left and started walking to the first bus stop 30 minutes early. It was HOT, 94\\u00b0F at the sun\'s apogee, and I was drenched in sweat within the five minutes of stepping outside. I got to the bus stop twenty minutes early. The sun\'s merciless rays causing me to regret the mix of anticipation and apprehension that had convinced me it was wise to leave myself plenty of time to catch the bus. It is the same electric feeling I experience before embarking on any journey requiring the use of public transportation. Bus numbers and times and directions; the same numbers circulate through my mind. I switch back and forth between leaning against a wall and peering down the street to see if the bus is in sight. I increasingly choosing the latter, as the bus\'s arrival time grew nearer. Finally, a few minutes late, I make out my bus stopped at a light a few blocks away. Cash in hand, I eagerly step forward to the sign indicating that this was in fact a bus stop for bus #34. So imagine my surprise as the bus drives right past me and my sign and across the nearby intersection, stopping on the curb alongside a sign identical to the one I stood next to. I began sprinting across the intersection just as the light turned yellow, but this was one of those enormous crosswalks that offers pedestrians half a minute to make it across. I only managed to make it to the median before the light turned red. I was forced to watch helplessly from the middle of the road as people trickle off the bus, a few people get on, the doors swing shut, and my bus drives away. Thus ended any chance of me visiting the museum this year. I walked home feeling cross, opting to sulk on the couch and watch Keeping Up With The Kardashians for the rest of the afternoon.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>Cape Cod was also very beautiful. It\'s a very unique environment, one without any sort of alternative in my hometown of California. That\'s notable because California has practically every landscape imaginable. Cape Cod\'s charm comes from the diverse ecosystems it supports. Ranging from highlands to dunes, meadows to salt marshes, Massachusetts\'s peninsula is full of biodiversity that all its visitors appreciate. I stayed with my childhood friend, Koby, at his family\'s Cape house for three days. He was working on the Cape over the summer at a outdoor ropes course, so I had a lot of time to myself during the mornings\\/afternoons over the course of my stay. Here I finished reading Pride and Prejudice, a personal favorite of mine, seated on a bench centered in the house\'s colorful garden. I also had the pleasure of visiting the Cape Cod Museum of Natural History and attending one of its nature walks. Although this certainly was not the Harvard museum I mentioned before, its whale exhibit was interesting and trails were beautiful and extensive, and I was able to satiate my urge to visit some a natural history museum while in Massachusetts. An urge I know all Americans struggle with...\\r\\n<\\/p><p><img src=\\\"..\\/..\\/assets\\/img\\/vacation\\/cape-cod-meadow.jpg#asset:76\\\"><br><\\/p><p>I returned to San Jose on July 22nd, spending a week at home before leaving for another mini-vacation. My father, little sister Ally, and I drove down to Long Beach to catch a ferry to Santa Catalina. My older sister Molly had acquired a summer job on the island driving buses. This isn\'t the first time her bus driving skills have offered her the opportunity to work on an island. Last summer she drove buses on Martha\'s Vineyard, Cape Cod\'s very own island getaway. I figure next year she\'ll be driving buses in the Bahamas. Santa Catalina is absolutely incredible. Eighty percent of the island is a preserved by the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy, so the island really has just two populated towns, Avalon and Two Harbors. My sister stayed in Avalon. The island company, the entity which imported the workforce for the island\'s tourist attractions, housed all of its employees in a comfortable apartment complex (nicknamed \'Monkeytown\') for dirt-cheap rent. Tourist attractions include bus tours of the island\'s interior, the island\'s zip-line course, and the beaches with their various bars and restaurants. My father and younger sister stayed two days, but I chose to stay with my sister for the remainder of the week. I slept with her at Monkeytown, in the backyard of the male employees\' complex. A few of the guys there are rugged outdoorsish types, and one of them had a hammock struck up in back. I slept in his hammock every night, waking up each morning enamored by the island and its beauty. Every morning, I would wake up to the sun painting the face of the adjacent mountainside. Each day, I\'d get dressed and walk to town to grab a coffee. Once inn town, I\'d walk to some benches and read on the oceanfront for an hour or so. Some days, I\'d treat myself after reading and grab breakfast at this nice little cafe. Granted, everything on the island is expensive. But I decided to embrace the vacation spirit and spend shamelessly, to the injury of my car fund... I absolutely fell in love with the island and was very sad to leave it. I definitely have to visit again at some point in my life.\\r\\n<\\/p><p><img src=\\\"..\\/..\\/assets\\/img\\/vacation\\/catalina-wrigley-memorial.jpg#asset:80\\\"><br>\\r\\n<\\/p><p>I ferried back to Long Beach at 7:30 Friday morning. Back on the North American continent, I bused my way to LA Union Station and hopped on a train to Oceanside with the intention of visiting a good friend living further south. There, I hung around a local coffee shop and waited a few hours for my bus. My bus arrives and takes me to Temecula, CA, my destination. My buddy Steve is waiting for me at the bus stop. We head back to his place where I proceed to pass out after inhaling some dinner. Public transit is exhausting. Temecula is admittedly less glamorous than Santa Catalina, but I had a good time seeing  my buddy Steve after nine months apart. We spent the weekend playing video games and hanging out poolside, two of the few decent things to do in that town. Monday morning I began my long journey home, busing from Temecula back to Oceanside and hopping on a train from there to Santa Barbara. My friend Tommy picks me up from the station Monday evening, takes me back to his place, and we spend the evening relaxing. Tuesday afternoon and I resume my journey: Tommy takes me to the transit center where I hop on a spacious bus headed to San Fransisco. The bus stops in San Jose after 6 hours, and my dad is waiting at the station. He drops me off at home where I pass out, drained from the last two days of travel.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>That was about three days ago. It feels good to be back home for the long haul.

The sun\'s merciless rays causing me to regret the mix of anticipation and apprehension that had convinced me it was wise to leave myself plenty of time to catch the bus. It is the same electric feeling I experience before embarking on any journey requiring the use of public transportation. Bus numbers and times and directions; the same numbers circulate through my mind. I switch back and forth between leaning against a wall and peering down the street to see if the bus is in sight. I increasingly choosing the latter, as the bus\'s arrival time grew nearer. Finally, a few minutes late, I make out my bus stopped at a light a few blocks away. Cash in hand, I eagerly step forward to the sign indicating that this was in fact a bus stop for bus #34. So imagine my surprise as the bus drives right past me and my sign and across the nearby intersection, stopping on the curb alongside a sign identical to the one I stood next to. I began sprinting across the intersection just as the light turned yellow, but this was one of those enormous crosswalks that offers pedestrians half a minute to make it across. I only managed to make it to the median before the light turned red. I was forced to watch helplessly from the middle of the road as people trickle off the bus, a few people get on, the doors swing shut, and my bus drives away.

I stayed with my childhood friend, Koby, at his family\'s Cape house for three days.

My father, little sister Ally, and I drove down to Long Beach to catch a ferry to Santa Catalina. My older sister Molly had acquired a summer job on the island driving buses. This isn\'t the first time her bus driving skills have offered her the opportunity to work on an island. Last summer she drove buses on Martha\'s Vineyard, Cape Cod\'s very own island getaway. I figure next year she\'ll be driving buses in the Bahamas. Santa Catalina is absolutely incredible. Eighty percent of the island is a preserved by the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy, so the island really has just two populated towns, Avalon and Two Harbors. My sister stayed in Avalon. The island company, the entity which imported the workforce for the island\'s tourist attractions, housed all of its employees in a comfortable apartment complex (nicknamed \'Monkeytown\') for dirt-cheap rent. Tourist attractions include bus tours of the island\'s interior, the island\'s zip-line course, and the beaches with their various bars and restaurants. My father and younger sister stayed two days, but I chose to stay with my sister for the remainder of the week. I slept with her at Monkeytown, in the backyard of the male employees\' complex. A few of the guys there are rugged outdoorsish types, and one of them had a hammock struck up in back. I slept in his hammock every night, waking up each morning enamored by the island and its beauty. Every morning, I would wake up to the sun painting the face of the adjacent mountainside. Each day, I\'d get dressed and walk to town to grab a coffee. Once inn town, I\'d walk to some benches and read on the oceanfront for an hour or so. Some days, I\'d treat myself after reading and grab breakfast at this nice little cafe. Granted, everything on the island is expensive. But I decided to embrace the vacation spirit and spend shamelessly, to the injury of my car fund... I absolutely fell in love with the island and was very sad to leave it. I definitely have to visit again at some point in my life.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"..\\/..\\/assets\\/img\\/vacation\\/catalina-wrigley-memorial.jpg#asset:80:url\\\"><br>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>I ferried back to Long Beach at 7:30 Friday morning.

But it wouldn\'t be a trip to Boston without some dejecting experience with public transit...\\r\\n<\\/p><p>On my last day in the city, I plotted out a visit to the Harvard Museum of Natural History using the city\'s bus system. To ensure that I wouldn\'t have any issues getting there, I left and started walking to the first bus stop 30 minutes early. It was HOT, 94\\u00b0F at the sun\'s apogee, and I was drenched in sweat within the five minutes of stepping outside. I got to the bus stop twenty minutes early. The sun\'s merciless rays causing me to regret the mix of anticipation and apprehension that had convinced me it was wise to leave myself plenty of time to catch the bus. It is the same electric feeling I experience before embarking on any journey requiring the use of public transportation. Bus numbers and times and directions; the same numbers circulate through my mind. I switch back and forth between leaning against a wall and peering down the street to see if the bus is in sight. I increasingly choosing the latter, as the bus\'s arrival time grew nearer. Finally, a few minutes late, I make out my bus stopped at a light a few blocks away. Cash in hand, I eagerly step forward to the sign indicating that this was in fact a bus stop for bus #34. So imagine my surprise as the bus drives right past me and my sign and across the nearby intersection, stopping on the curb alongside a sign identical to the one I stood next to. I began sprinting across the intersection just as the light turned yellow, but this was one of those enormous crosswalks that offers pedestrians half a minute to make it across. I only managed to make it to the median before the light turned red. I was forced to watch helplessly from the middle of the road as people trickle off the bus, a few people get on, the doors swing shut, and my bus drives away. Thus ended any chance of me visiting the museum this year. I walked home feeling cross, opting to sulk on the couch and watch Keeping Up With The Kardashians for the rest of the afternoon.

It\'s a very unique environment, one without any sort of alternative in my hometown of California. That\'s notable because California has practically every landscape imaginable. Cape Cod\'s charm comes from the diverse ecosystems it supports. Ranging from highlands to dunes, meadows to salt marshes, Massachusetts\'s peninsula is full of biodiversity that all its visitors appreciate. I stayed with my childhood friend, Koby, at his family\'s Cape house for three days. He was working on the Cape over the summer at a outdoor ropes course, so I had a lot of time to myself during the mornings\\/afternoons over the course of my stay. Here I finished reading Pride and Prejudice, a personal favorite of mine, seated on a bench centered in the house\'s colorful garden. I also had the pleasure of visiting the Cape Cod Museum of Natural History and attending one of its nature walks.

My father, little sister Ally, and I drove down to Long Beach to catch a ferry to Santa Catalina. My older sister Molly had acquired a summer job on the island driving buses. This isn\'t the first time her bus driving skills have offered her the opportunity to work on an island. Last summer she drove buses on Martha\'s Vineyard, Cape Cod\'s very own island getaway. I figure next year she\'ll be driving buses in the Bahamas. Santa Catalina is absolutely incredible. Eighty percent of the island is a preserved by the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy, so the island really has just two populated towns, Avalon and Two Harbors. My sister stayed in Avalon. The island company, the entity which imported the workforce for the island\'s tourist attractions, housed all of its employees in a comfortable apartment complex (nicknamed \'Monkeytown\') for dirt-cheap rent. Tourist attractions include bus tours of the island\'s interior, the island\'s zip-line course, and the beaches with their various bars and restaurants. My father and younger sister stayed two days, but I chose to stay with my sister for the remainder of the week. I slept with her at Monkeytown, in the backyard of the male employees\' complex. A few of the guys there are rugged outdoorsish types, and one of them had a hammock struck up in back. I slept in his hammock every night, waking up each morning enamored by the island and its beauty. Every morning, I would wake up to the sun painting the face of the adjacent mountainside. Each day, I\'d get dressed and walk to town to grab a coffee. Once inn town, I\'d walk to some benches and read on the oceanfront for an hour or so. Some days, I\'d treat myself after reading and grab breakfast at this nice little cafe. Granted, everything on the island is expensive. But I decided to embrace the vacation spirit and spend shamelessly, to the injury of my car fund... I absolutely fell in love with the island and was very sad to leave it. I definitely have to visit again at some point in my life.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"..\\/..\\/assets\\/img\\/vacation\\/catalina-wrigley-memorial.jpg#asset:80:url\\\"><br>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>I ferried back to Long Beach at 7:30 Friday morning. Back on the North American continent, I bused my way to LA Union Station and hopped on a train to Oceanside with the intention of visiting a good friend living further south. There, I hung around a local coffee shop and waited a few hours for my bus. My bus arrives and takes me to Temecula, CA, my destination. My buddy Steve is waiting for me at the bus stop. We head back to his place where I proceed to pass out after inhaling some dinner. Public transit is exhausting. Temecula is admittedly less glamorous than Santa Catalina, but I had a good time seeing  my buddy Steve after nine months apart. We spent the weekend playing video games and hanging out poolside, two of the few decent things to do in that town. Monday morning I began my long journey home, busing from Temecula back to Oceanside and hopping on a train from there to Santa Barbara. My friend Tommy picks me up from the station Monday evening, takes me back to his place, and we spend the evening relaxing. Tuesday afternoon and I resume my journey: Tommy takes me to the transit center where I hop on a spacious bus headed to San Fransisco. The bus stops in San Jose after 6 hours, and my dad is waiting at the station. He drops me off at home where I pass out, drained from the last two days of travel.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"..\\/..\\/assets\\/img\\/vacation\\/catalina-hammock.jpg#asset:77:url\\\"><br><\\/p><p>Since returning from my travels, I\'ve been transitioning back to a lifestyle geared toward productivity.

I slept in his hammock every night, waking up each morning enamored by the island and its beauty. Every morning, I would wake up to the sun painting the face of the adjacent mountainside. Each day, I\'d get dressed and walk to town to grab a coffee. Once inn town, I\'d walk to some benches and read on the oceanfront for an hour or so. Some days, I\'d treat myself after reading and grab breakfast at this nice little cafe. Granted, everything on the island is expensive. But I decided to embrace the vacation spirit and spend shamelessly, to the injury of my car fund... I absolutely fell in love with the island and was very sad to leave it. I definitely have to visit again at some point in my life.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"..\\/..\\/assets\\/img\\/vacation\\/catalina-wrigley-memorial.jpg#asset:80:url\\\"><br>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>I ferried back to Long Beach at 7:30 on a Friday morning. Back on the North American continent, I bused my way to LA Union Station and hopped on a train to Oceanside with the intention of visiting a good friend living further south. There, I hung around a local coffee shop and waited a few hours for my bus. My bus arrives and takes me to Temecula, CA, my destination. My buddy Steve is waiting for me at the bus stop. We head back to his place where I proceed to pass out after inhaling some dinner. Public transit is exhausting. Temecula is admittedly less glamorous than Santa Catalina, but I had a good time seeing  my buddy Steve after nine months apart. We spent the weekend playing video games and hanging out poolside, two of the few decent things to do in that town. Monday morning I began my long journey home, busing from Temecula back to Oceanside and hopping on a train from there to Santa Barbara. My friend Tommy picks me up from the station Monday evening, takes me back to his place, and we spend the evening relaxing. Tuesday afternoon and I resume my journey: Tommy takes me to the transit center where I hop on a spacious bus headed to San Fransisco. The bus stops in San Jose after 6 hours, and my dad is waiting at the station. He drops me off at home where I pass out, drained from the last two days of travel.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"..\\/..\\/assets\\/img\\/vacation\\/catalina-hammock.jpg#asset:77:url\\\"><br><\\/p><p>Since returning from my travels, I\'ve been transitioning back to a lifestyle geared toward productivity.

Visiting Boston was pleasant at usual, despite the awful heat that hung over the city. I got to take a cruise around the Boston Harbor and eat delicious veal in the dimly lit cellar of some authentic Italian restaurant on the North End. But it wouldn\'t be a trip to Boston without some dejecting experience with public transit...\\r\\n<\\/p><p>On my last day in the city, I plotted out a visit to the Harvard Museum of Natural History using the city\'s bus system. To ensure that I wouldn\'t have any issues getting there, I left and started walking to the first bus stop 30 minutes early. It was HOT, 94\\u00b0F at the sun\'s apogee, and I was drenched in sweat within the five minutes of stepping outside. I got to the bus stop twenty minutes early. The sun\'s merciless rays causing me to regret the mix of anticipation and apprehension that had convinced me it was wise to leave myself plenty of time to catch the bus. It is the same electric feeling I experience before embarking on any journey requiring the use of public transportation. Bus numbers and times and directions; the same numbers circulate through my mind. I switch back and forth between leaning against a wall and peering down the street to see if the bus is in sight. I increasingly choosing the latter, as the bus\'s arrival time grew nearer. Finally, a few minutes late, I make out my bus stopped at a light a few blocks away. Cash in hand, I eagerly step forward to the sign indicating that this was in fact a bus stop for bus #34. So imagine my surprise as the bus drives right past me and my sign and across the nearby intersection, stopping on the curb alongside a sign identical to the one I stood next to. I began sprinting across the intersection just as the light turned yellow, but this was one of those enormous crosswalks that offers pedestrians half a minute to make it across. I only managed to make it to the median before the light turned red. I was forced to watch helplessly from the middle of the road as people trickle off the bus, a few people get on, the doors swing shut, and my bus drives away. Thus ended any chance of me visiting the museum this year. I walked home feeling cross, opting to sulk on the couch and watch Keeping Up With The Kardashians for the rest of the afternoon. On the bright side, my anticipation for next year\'s visit to the museum will make its eventual completion all the more satisfying. <\\/p><p>Cape Cod was also very beautiful. It\'s a very unique environment, one without any sort of alternative in my hometown of California. That\'s notable because California is home to practically every landscape the U.S. has to offer. Cape Cod\'s charm comes from the diverse ecosystems it supports. Ranging from highlands to dunes, meadows to salt marshes, Massachusetts\'s peninsula is full of biodiversity that all its visitors appreciate. I stayed with my childhood friend, Koby, at his family\'s Cape house for three days. He was working on the Cape over the summer at a outdoor ropes course, so I had a lot of time to myself during the mornings\\/afternoons over the course of my stay. Here I finished reading Pride and Prejudice, a personal favorite of mine, seated on a bench centered in the house\'s colorful garden. I also had the pleasure of visiting the Cape Cod Museum of Natural History and attending one of its nature walks. Although this certainly was not the Harvard museum I mentioned before, its whale exhibit was interesting and trails were beautiful and extensive, and I was able to satiate my urge to visit some a natural history museum while in Massachusetts.

My father, little sister Ally, and I drove down to Long Beach to catch a ferry to Santa Catalina. My older sister Molly had acquired a summer job on the island driving buses. This isn\'t the first time her bus driving skills have offered her the opportunity to work on an island. Last summer she drove buses on Martha\'s Vineyard, Cape Cod\'s very own island getaway. I figure next year she\'ll be driving buses in the Bahamas. Santa Catalina is absolutely incredible. Eighty percent of the island is a preserved by the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy, so the island really has just two populated towns, Avalon and Two Harbors. My sister stayed in Avalon. The island company, the entity which imported the workforce for the island\'s tourist attractions, housed all of its employees in a comfortable apartment complex (nicknamed \'Monkeytown\') for dirt-cheap rent. Tourist attractions include bus tours of the island\'s interior, the island\'s zip-line course, and the beaches with their various bars and restaurants.

He was working on the Cape over the summer at a outdoor ropes course, so I had a lot of time to myself during the mornings\\/afternoons over the course of my stay. Here I finished reading Pride and Prejudice, a personal favorite of mine, seated on a bench centered in the house\'s colorful garden. I also had the pleasure of visiting the Cape Cod Museum of Natural History and attending one of its nature walks.

My father, little sister Ally, and I drove down to Long Beach to catch a ferry to Santa Catalina. My older sister Molly had acquired a summer job on the island driving buses. This isn\'t the first time her bus driving skills have offered her the opportunity to work on an island. Last summer she drove buses on Martha\'s Vineyard, Cape Cod\'s very own island getaway. I figure next year she\'ll be driving buses in the Bahamas. Santa Catalina is absolutely incredible. Eighty percent of the island is a preserved by the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy, so the island really has just two populated towns, Avalon and Two Harbors. My sister stayed in Avalon. The island company, the entity which imported the workforce for the island\'s tourist attractions, housed all of its employees in a comfortable apartment complex (nicknamed \'Monkeytown\') for dirt-cheap rent. Tourist attractions include bus tours of the island\'s interior, the island\'s zip-line course, and the beaches with their various bars and restaurants. My father and younger sister stayed two days, but I chose to stay with my sister for the remainder of the week. I slept with her at Monkeytown, in the backyard of the male employees\' complex. A few of the guys there are rugged outdoorsish types, and one of them had a hammock struck up in back. I slept in his hammock every night, waking up each morning enamored by the island and its beauty. Every morning, I would wake up to the sun painting the face of the adjacent mountainside. Each day, I\'d get dressed and walk to town to grab a coffee. Once inn town, I\'d walk to some benches and read on the oceanfront for an hour or so. Some days, I\'d treat myself after reading and grab breakfast at this nice little cafe. Granted, everything on the island is expensive. But I decided to embrace the vacation spirit and spend shamelessly, to the injury of my car fund... I absolutely fell in love with the island and was very sad to leave it. I definitely have to visit again at some point in my life.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"..\\/..\\/assets\\/img\\/vacation\\/catalina-wrigley-memorial.jpg#asset:80:url\\\"><br>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>I ferried back to Long Beach at 7:30 on a Friday morning. Back on the North American continent, I bused my way to LA Union Station and hopped on a train to Oceanside with the intention of visiting a good friend living further south. There, I hung around a local coffee shop and waited a few hours for my bus. My bus arrives and takes me to Temecula, CA, my destination. My buddy Steve is waiting for me at the bus stop. We head back to his place where I proceed to pass out after inhaling some dinner. Public transit is exhausting. Temecula is admittedly less glamorous than Santa Catalina, but I had a good time seeing  my buddy Steve after nine months apart. We spent the weekend playing video games and hanging out poolside, two of the few decent things to do in that town. Monday morning I began my long journey home, busing from Temecula back to Oceanside and hopping on a train from there to Santa Barbara. My friend Tommy picks me up from the station Monday evening, takes me back to his place, and we spend the evening relaxing. Tuesday afternoon and I resume my journey: Tommy takes me to the transit center where I hop on a spacious bus headed to San Fransisco. The bus stops in San Jose after 6 hours, and my dad is waiting at the station. He drops me off at home where I pass out, drained from the last two days of travel.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"..\\/..\\/assets\\/img\\/vacation\\/catalina-hammock.jpg#asset:77:url\\\"><br>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Since returning from my travels, I\'ve been transitioning back to a lifestyle geared toward productivity.

My father, little sister Ally, and I drove down to Long Beach to catch a ferry to Santa Catalina. My older sister Molly had acquired a summer job on the island driving buses. This isn\'t the first time her bus driving skills have offered her the opportunity to work on an island. Last summer she drove buses on Martha\'s Vineyard, Cape Cod\'s very own island getaway. I figure next year she\'ll be driving buses in the Bahamas. Santa Catalina is absolutely incredible. Eighty percent of the island is a preserved by the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy, so the island really has just two populated towns, Avalon and Two Harbors. My sister stayed in Avalon. The island company, the entity which imported the workforce for the island\'s tourist attractions, housed all of its employees in a comfortable apartment complex (nicknamed \'Monkeytown\') for dirt-cheap rent. Tourist attractions include bus tours of the island\'s interior, the island\'s zip-line course, and the beaches with their various bars and restaurants. My father and younger sister stayed two days, but I chose to stay with my sister for the remainder of the week. I slept with her at Monkeytown, in the backyard of the male employees\' complex. A few of the guys there are rugged outdoorsish types, and one of them had a hammock struck up in back. I slept in his hammock every night, waking up each morning enamored by the island and its beauty. Every morning, I would wake up to the sun painting the face of the adjacent mountainside. Each day, I\'d get dressed and walk to town to grab a coffee. Once inn town, I\'d walk to some benches and read on the oceanfront for an hour or so. Some days, I\'d treat myself after reading and grab breakfast at this nice little cafe. Granted, everything on the island is expensive. But I decided to embrace the vacation spirit and spend shamelessly, to the injury of my car fund... I absolutely fell in love with the island and was very sad to leave it. I definitely have to visit again at some point in my life.<\\/p><p><img src=\\\"..\\/..\\/assets\\/img\\/vacation\\/catalina-wrigley-memorial.jpg#asset:80:url\\\"><br><\\/p><p>I ferried back to Long Beach at 7:30 on a Friday morning. Back on the North American continent, I bused my way to LA Union Station and hopped on a train to Oceanside with the intention of visiting a good friend living further south. There, I hung around a local coffee shop and waited a few hours for my bus. My bus arrives and takes me to Temecula, CA, my destination. My buddy Steve is waiting for me at the bus stop. We head back to his place where I proceed to pass out after inhaling some dinner. Public transit is exhausting. Temecula is admittedly less glamorous than Santa Catalina, but I had a good time seeing my buddy Steve after nine months apart. We spent the weekend playing video games and hanging out poolside, two of the few decent things to do in that town.

My friend Tommy picks me up from the station Monday evening, takes me back to his place, and we spend the evening relaxing.

While I chiefly stayed in Scituate, a charming little harbor town, I had the pleasure of traveling all over the state. Visiting Boston was pleasant at usual, despite the awful heat that hung over the city. I got to take a cruise around the Boston Harbor and eat delicious veal in the dimly lit cellar of some authentic Italian restaurant on the North End. But it wouldn\'t be a trip to Boston without some dejecting experience with public transit...\\r\\n<\\/p><p>On my last day in the city, I plotted out a visit to the Harvard Museum of Natural History using the city\'s bus system. To ensure that I wouldn\'t have any issues getting there, I left and started walking to the first bus stop 30 minutes early. It was HOT, 94\\u00b0F at the sun\'s apogee, and I was drenched in sweat within the five minutes of stepping outside. I got to the bus stop twenty minutes early. The sun\'s merciless rays causing me to regret the mix of anticipation and apprehension that had convinced me it was wise to leave myself plenty of time to catch the bus. It is the same electric feeling I experience before embarking on any journey requiring the use of public transportation. Bus numbers and times and directions; the same numbers circulate through my mind. I switch back and forth between leaning against a wall and peering down the street to see if the bus is in sight. I increasingly choosing the latter, as the bus\'s arrival time grew nearer. Finally, a few minutes late, I make out my bus stopped at a light a few blocks away. Cash in hand, I eagerly step forward to the sign indicating that this was in fact a bus stop for bus #34. So imagine my surprise as the bus drives right past me and my sign and across the nearby intersection, stopping on the curb alongside a sign identical to the one I stood next to. I began sprinting across the intersection just as the light turned yellow, but this was one of those enormous crosswalks that offers pedestrians half a minute to make it across. I only managed to make it to the median before the light turned red. I was forced to watch helplessly from the middle of the road as people trickle off the bus, a few people get on, the doors swing shut, and my bus drives away. Thus ended any chance of me visiting the museum this year. I walked home feeling cross, opting to sulk on the couch and watch Keeping Up With The Kardashians for the rest of the afternoon. On the bright side, my anticipation for next year\'s visit to the museum will make its eventual completion all the more satisfying.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>Cape Cod was also very beautiful. It\'s a very unique environment, one without any sort of alternative in my hometown of California. That\'s notable because California is home to practically every landscape the U.S. has to offer. Cape Cod\'s charm comes from the diverse ecosystems it supports. Ranging from highlands to dunes, meadows to salt marshes, Massachusetts\'s peninsula is full of biodiversity that all its visitors appreciate. I stayed with my childhood friend, Koby, at his family\'s Cape house for three days. He was working on the Cape over the summer at a outdoor ropes course, so I had a lot of time to myself during the mornings\\/afternoons over the course of my stay. Here I finished reading Pride and Prejudice, a personal favorite of mine, seated on a bench centered in the house\'s colorful garden. I also had the pleasure of visiting the Cape Cod Museum of Natural History and attending one of its nature walks. Although this certainly was not the Harvard museum I mentioned before, its whale exhibit was interesting and trails were beautiful and extensive, and I was able to satiate my urge to visit some a natural history museum while in Massachusetts. An urge I know all Americans struggle with...\\r\\n<\\/p><p><img src=\\\"..\\/..\\/assets\\/img\\/vacation\\/cape-cod-meadow.jpg#asset:76:url\\\"><br>\\r\\n<\\/p><article>\\r\\n<p>I returned to San Jose on July 22nd, spending a week at home before leaving for another mini-vacation. My father, little sister Ally, and I drove down to Long Beach to catch a ferry to Santa Catalina. My older sister Molly had acquired a summer job on the island driving buses. This isn\'t the first time her bus driving skills have offered her the opportunity to work on an island. Last summer she drove buses on Martha\'s Vineyard, Cape Cod\'s very own island getaway. I figure next year she\'ll be driving buses in the Bahamas. Santa Catalina is absolutely incredible. Eighty percent of the island is a preserved by the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy, so the island really has just two populated towns, Avalon and Two Harbors. My sister stayed in Avalon. The island company, the entity which imported the workforce for the island\'s tourist attractions, housed all of its employees in a comfortable apartment complex (nicknamed \'Monkeytown\') for dirt-cheap rent. Tourist attractions include bus tours of the island\'s interior, the island\'s zip-line course, and the beaches with their various bars and restaurants. My father and younger sister stayed two days, but I chose to stay with my sister for the remainder of the week. I slept with her at Monkeytown, in the backyard of the male employees\' complex. A few of the guys there are rugged outdoorsish types, and one of them had a hammock struck up in back. I slept in his hammock every night, waking up each morning enamored by the island and its beauty. Every morning, I would wake up to the sun painting the face of the adjacent mountainside. Each day, I\'d get dressed and walk to town to grab a coffee. Once inn town, I\'d walk to some benches and read on the oceanfront for an hour or so. Some days, I\'d treat myself after reading and grab breakfast at this nice little cafe. Granted, everything on the island is expensive. But I decided to embrace the vacation spirit and spend shamelessly, to the injury of my car fund... I absolutely fell in love with the island and was very sad to leave it. I definitely have to visit again at some point in my life.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"..\\/..\\/assets\\/img\\/vacation\\/catalina-wrigley-memorial.jpg#asset:80:url\\\"><br>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>I ferried back to Long Beach at 7:30 on a Friday morning. Back on the North American continent, I bused my way to LA Union Station and hopped on a train to Oceanside with the intention of visiting a good friend living further south. There, I hung around a local coffee shop and waited a few hours for my bus. My bus arrives and takes me to Temecula, CA, my destination. My buddy Steve is waiting for me at the bus stop. We head back to his place where I proceed to pass out after inhaling some dinner. Public transit is exhausting. Temecula is admittedly less glamorous than Santa Catalina, but I had a good time seeing  my buddy Steve after nine months apart. We spent the weekend playing video games and hanging out poolside, two of the few decent things to do in that town. Monday morning I began my long journey home, busing from Temecula back to Oceanside and hopping on a train from there to Santa Barbara. My friend Tommy picks me up from the station Monday evening, takes me back to his place, and we spend the evening relaxing. Tuesday afternoon and I resume my journey: Tommy takes me to the transit center where I hop on a spacious bus headed to San Fransisco. The bus stops in San Jose after 6 hours, and my dad is waiting at the station. He drops me off at home where I pass out, drained from the last two days of travel.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"..\\/..\\/assets\\/img\\/vacation\\/catalina-hammock.jpg#asset:77:url\\\"><br>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Since returning from my travels, I\'ve been transitioning back to a lifestyle geared toward productivity.

Alas, this will come as a surprise to many but I am not dead. I am also not horribly injured. I realize that it has been many weeks since my last update.

No, it was negligence. Negligence brought on by the folly and whimsical nature of Summer. But as Autumn arrives, follies must be put aside. I would feel remiss, however, if I didn\'t keep my beloved followers informed of all my Summer adventures...\\r\\n<\\/p><p>My visit to Massachusetts was a fulfilling one. With 7 aunts, 2 uncles, and a myriad of cousins and nephews, I was certainly kept busy. While I chiefly stayed in Scituate, a charming little harbor town, I had the pleasure of traveling all over the state. Visiting Boston was pleasant at usual, despite the awful heat that hung over the city. I got to take a cruise around the Boston Harbor and eat delicious veal in the dimly lit cellar of some authentic Italian restaurant on the North End. But it wouldn\'t be a trip to Boston without some dejecting experience with public transit...\\r\\n<\\/p><p>On my last day in the city, I plotted out a visit to the Harvard Museum of Natural History using the city\'s bus system. To ensure that I wouldn\'t have any issues getting there, I left and started walking to the first bus stop 30 minutes early. It was HOT, 94\\u00b0F at the sun\'s apogee, and I was drenched in sweat within the five minutes of stepping outside. I got to the bus stop twenty minutes early. The sun\'s merciless rays causing me to regret the mix of anticipation and apprehension that had convinced me it was wise to leave myself plenty of time to catch the bus. It is the same electric feeling I experience before embarking on any journey requiring the use of public transportation. Bus numbers and times and directions; the same numbers circulate through my mind. I switch back and forth between leaning against a wall and peering down the street to see if the bus is in sight. I increasingly choosing the latter, as the bus\'s arrival time grew nearer. Finally, a few minutes late, I make out my bus stopped at a light a few blocks away. Cash in hand, I eagerly step forward to the sign indicating that this was in fact a bus stop for bus #34. So imagine my surprise as the bus drives right past me and my sign and across the nearby intersection, stopping on the curb alongside a sign identical to the one I stood next to. I began sprinting across the intersection just as the light turned yellow, but this was one of those enormous crosswalks that offers pedestrians half a minute to make it across. I only managed to make it to the median before the light turned red. I was forced to watch helplessly from the middle of the road as people trickle off the bus, a few people get on, the doors swing shut, and my bus drives away. Thus ended any chance of me visiting the museum this year. I walked home feeling cross, opting to sulk on the couch and watch Keeping Up With The Kardashians for the rest of the afternoon. On the bright side, my anticipation for next year\'s visit to the museum will make its eventual completion all the more satisfying.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>Cape Cod was also very beautiful. It\'s a very unique environment, one without any sort of alternative in my hometown of California. That\'s notable because California is home to practically every landscape the U.S. has to offer. Cape Cod\'s charm comes from the diverse ecosystems it supports. Ranging from highlands to dunes, meadows to salt marshes, Massachusetts\'s peninsula is full of biodiversity that all its visitors appreciate. I stayed with my childhood friend, Koby, at his family\'s Cape house for three days. He was working on the Cape over the summer at a outdoor ropes course, so I had a lot of time to myself during the mornings\\/afternoons over the course of my stay. Here I finished reading Pride and Prejudice, a personal favorite of mine, seated on a bench centered in the house\'s colorful garden. I also had the pleasure of visiting the Cape Cod Museum of Natural History and attending one of its nature walks. Although this certainly was not the Harvard museum I mentioned before, its whale exhibit was interesting and trails were beautiful and extensive, and I was able to satiate my urge to visit some a natural history museum while in Massachusetts. An urge I know all Americans struggle with...\\r\\n<\\/p><p><br>\\r\\n<\\/p><p>I returned to San Jose on July 22nd, spending a week at home before leaving for another mini-vacation. My father, little sister Ally, and I drove down to Long Beach to catch a ferry to Santa Catalina. My older sister Molly had acquired a summer job on the island driving buses. This isn\'t the first time her bus driving skills have offered her the opportunity to work on an island. Last summer she drove buses on Martha\'s Vineyard, Cape Cod\'s very own island getaway. I figure next year she\'ll be driving buses in the Bahamas. Santa Catalina is absolutely incredible. Eighty percent of the island is a preserved by the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy, so the island really has just two populated towns, Avalon and Two Harbors. My sister stayed in Avalon. The island company, the entity which imported the workforce for the island\'s tourist attractions, housed all of its employees in a comfortable apartment complex (nicknamed \'Monkeytown\') for dirt-cheap rent. Tourist attractions include bus tours of the island\'s interior, the island\'s zip-line course, and the beaches with their various bars and restaurants. My father and younger sister stayed two days, but I chose to stay with my sister for the remainder of the week. I slept with her at Monkeytown, in the backyard of the male employees\' complex. A few of the guys there are rugged outdoorsish types, and one of them had a hammock struck up in back. I slept in his hammock every night, waking up each morning enamored by the island and its beauty. Every morning, I would wake up to the sun painting the face of the adjacent mountainside. Each day, I\'d get dressed and walk to town to grab a coffee. Once inn town, I\'d walk to some benches and read on the oceanfront for an hour or so. Some days, I\'d treat myself after reading and grab breakfast at this nice little cafe. Granted, everything on the island is expensive. But I decided to embrace the vacation spirit and spend shamelessly, to the injury of my car fund... I absolutely fell in love with the island and was very sad to leave it. I definitely have to visit again at some point in my life.\\r\\n<\\/p><p><br>\\r\\n<\\/p><p>I ferried back to Long Beach at 7:30 on a Friday morning. Back on the North American continent, I bused my way to LA Union Station and hopped on a train to Oceanside with the intention of visiting a good friend living further south. There, I hung around a local coffee shop and waited a few hours for my bus. My bus arrives and takes me to Temecula, CA, my destination. My buddy Steve is waiting for me at the bus stop. We head back to his place where I proceed to pass out after inhaling some dinner. Public transit is exhausting. Temecula is admittedly less glamorous than Santa Catalina, but I had a good time seeing my buddy Steve after nine months apart. We spent the weekend playing video games and hanging out poolside, two of the few decent things to do in that town. Monday morning I began my long journey home, busing from Temecula back to Oceanside and hopping on a train from there to Santa Barbara. My friend Tommy picks me up from the station Monday evening, takes me back to his place, and we spend the evening relaxing. Tuesday afternoon and I resume my journey: Tommy takes me to the transit center where I hop on a spacious bus headed to San Fransisco. The bus stops in San Jose after 6 hours, and my dad is waiting at the station. He drops me off at home where I pass out, drained from the last two days of travel.\\r\\n<\\/p><p><br>\\r\\n<\\/p><p>Since returning from my travels, I\'ve been transitioning back to a lifestyle geared toward productivity. No upcoming trips to look forward to, significantly less free time, and the looming responsibilities I\'ll have once I start college late September. While I will always appreciate periods of time where I have less responsibilities, I thrive with structure. Without responsibilities it is easy for one to fall into apathy. But amidst school, work, and working on bettering myself, there is no room for apathy. My attention is primarily fixed on continuing to learn about\\/hone my skills with Craft and Twig, but I also have begun learning about version control and Git. Sometimes, it feels like with each new software or language I attempt to add to my arsenal, ten other concepts must first be mastered. I recently ran into this experience while working on a Git Basics course on laracasts.com. While I actually enjoy working in a command-line interface, I began to stumble as the course instructor introduced the dependency manager Composer and the installation of packages; no matter what I tried, I couldn\'t produce the same output as the instructor. It\'s frustrating for me when I can\'t figure something out right away. But eventually my struggles paid off when I finally worked out the problem \\u2013 the shell configuration in my system was all screwed up, thanks to my having ignorantly fiddled with my system\'s programs back when I first began working with the CLI. I consequently reconfigured my default programs and was able to continue the Git course. This accomplishment was not an important one, but a small victory. As I continue to grow and develop my skills and knowledge, I must remember to celebrate all \\\"victories\\\", be them big or small. Daunting as web development and its intricacies may at times seem, persistence, discipline, and a little bit of optimism make a world of difference.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>Until next time!\\r\\n<\\/p>\",\"2\":\"\"}}', '2015-08-31 05:51:06', '2015-08-31 05:51:06', 'f343cd1e-74aa-4c0a-bad4-539b2a06690c');

but i am not dead i am also not horribly injured i realize that it has been many weeks since my last update surely this has caused a number of brooding concerns about my health so i wanted to dispel any wild rumors circulating around it was no malady or injury that kept me from updating my blog no it was negligence negligence brought on by the folly and whimsical nature of summer but as autumn arrives follies must be put aside i would feel remiss however if i didn t keep my beloved followers informed of all my summer adventures my visit to massachusetts was a fulfilling one with 7 aunts 2 uncles and a myriad of cousins and nephews i was certainly kept busy while i chiefly stayed in scituate a charming little harbor town i had the pleasure of traveling all over the state visiting boston was pleasant at usual despite the awful heat that hung over the city i got to take a cruise around the boston harbor and eat delicious veal in the dimly lit cellar of some authentic italian restaurant on the north end but it wouldn t be a trip to boston without some dejecting experience with public transit on my last day in the city i plotted out a visit to the harvard museum of natural history using the city s bus system to ensure that i wouldn t have any issues getting there i left and started walking to the first bus stop 30 minutes early it was hot 94 f at the sun s apogee and i was drenched in sweat within the five minutes of stepping outside i got to the bus stop twenty minutes early the sun s merciless rays causing me to regret the mix of anticipation and apprehension that had convinced me it was wise to leave myself plenty of time to catch the bus it is the same electric feeling i experience before embarking on any journey requiring the use of public transportation bus numbers and times and directions the same numbers circulate through my mind i switch back and forth between leaning against a wall and peering down the street to see if the bus is in sight i increasingly choosing the latter as the bus s arrival time grew nearer finally a few minutes late i make out my bus stopped at a light a few blocks away cash in hand i eagerly step forward to the sign indicating that this was in fact a bus stop for bus 34 so imagine my surprise as the bus drives right past me and my sign and across the nearby intersection stopping on the curb alongside a sign identical to the one i stood next to i began sprinting across the intersection just as the light turned yellow but this was one of those enormous crosswalks that offers pedestrians half a minute to make it across i only managed to make it to the median before the light turned red i was forced to watch helplessly from the middle of the road as people trickle off the bus a few people get on the doors swing shut and my bus drives away thus ended any chance of me visiting the museum this year i walked home feeling cross opting to sulk on the couch and watch keeping up with the kardashians for the rest of the afternoon on the bright side my anticipation for next year s visit to the museum will make its eventual completion all the more satisfying cape cod was also very beautiful it s a very unique environment one without any sort of alternative in my hometown of california that s notable because california is home to practically every landscape the u s has to offer cape cod s charm comes from the diverse ecosystems it supports ranging from highlands to dunes meadows to salt marshes massachusetts s peninsula is full of biodiversity that all its visitors appreciate i stayed with my childhood friend koby at his family s cape house for three days he was working on the cape over the summer at a outdoor ropes course so i had a lot of time to myself during the mornings afternoons over the course of my stay here i finished reading pride and prejudice a personal favorite of mine seated on a bench centered in the house s colorful garden i also had the pleasure of visiting the cape cod museum of natural history and attending one of its nature walks although this certainly was not the harvard museum i mentioned before its whale exhibit was interesting and trails were beautiful and extensive and i was able to satiate my urge to visit some a natural history museum while in massachusetts an urge i know all americans struggle with i returned to san jose on july 22nd spending a week at home before leaving for another mini vacation my father little sister ally and i drove down to long beach to catch a ferry to santa catalina my older sister molly had acquired a summer job on the island driving buses this isn t the first time her bus driving skills have offered her the opportunity to work on an island last summer she drove buses on martha s vineyard cape cod s very own island getaway i figure next year she ll be driving buses in the bahamas santa catalina is absolutely incredible eighty percent of the island is a preserved by the santa catalina island conservancy so the island really has just two populated towns avalon and two harbors my sister stayed in avalon the island company the entity which imported the workforce for the island s tourist attractions housed all of its employees in a comfortable apartment complex nicknamed monkeytown for dirt cheap rent tourist attractions include bus tours of the island s interior the island s zip line course and the beaches with their various bars and restaurants my father and younger sister stayed two days but i chose to stay with my sister for the remainder of the week i slept with her at monkeytown in the backyard of the male employees complex a few of the guys there are rugged outdoorsish types and one of them had a hammock struck up in back i slept in his hammock every night waking up each morning enamored by the island and its beauty every morning i would wake up to the sun painting the face of the adjacent mountainside each day i d get dressed and walk to town to grab a coffee once inn town i d walk to some benches and read on the oceanfront for an hour or so some days i d treat myself after reading and grab breakfast at this nice little cafe granted everything on the island is expensive but i decided to embrace the vacation spirit and spend shamelessly to the injury of my car fund i absolutely fell in love with the island and was very sad to leave it i definitely have to visit again at some point in my life i ferried back to long beach at 7 30 on a friday morning back on the north american continent i bused my way to la union station and hopped on a train to oceanside with the intention of visiting a good friend living further south there i hung around a local coffee shop and waited a few hours for my bus my bus arrives and takes me to temecula ca my destination my buddy steve is waiting for me at the bus stop we head back to his place where i proceed to pass out after inhaling some dinner public transit is exhausting temecula is admittedly less glamorous than santa catalina but i had a good time seeing my buddy steve after nine months apart we spent the weekend playing video games and hanging out poolside two of the few decent things to do in that town monday morning i began my long journey home busing from temecula back to oceanside and hopping on a train from there to santa barbara my friend tommy picks me up from the station monday evening takes me back to his place and we spend the evening relaxing tuesday afternoon and i resume my journey tommy takes me to the transit center where i hop on a spacious bus headed to san fransisco the bus stops in san jose after 6 hours and my dad is waiting at the station he drops me off at home where i pass out drained from the last two days of travel since returning from my travels i ve been transitioning back to a lifestyle geared toward productivity no upcoming trips to look forward to significantly less free time and the looming responsibilities i ll have once i start college late september while i will always appreciate periods of time where i have less responsibilities i thrive with structure without responsibilities it is easy for one to fall into apathy but amidst school work and working on bettering myself there is no room for apathy my attention is primarily fixed on continuing to learn about hone my skills with craft and twig but i also have begun learning about version control and git sometimes it feels like with each new software or language i attempt to add to my arsenal ten other concepts must first be mastered i recently ran into this experience while working on a git basics course on laracasts com while i actually enjoy working in a command line interface i began to stumble as the course instructor introduced the dependency manager composer and the installation of packages no matter what i tried i couldn t produce the same output as the instructor it s frustrating for me when i can t figure something out right away but eventually my struggles paid off when i finally worked out the problem the shell configuration in my system was all screwed up thanks to my having ignorantly fiddled with my system s programs back when i first began working with the cli i consequently reconfigured my default programs and was able to continue the git course this accomplishment was not an important one but a small victory as i continue to grow and develop my skills and knowledge i must remember to celebrate all victories be them big or small daunting as web development and its intricacies may at times seem persistence discipline and a little bit of optimism make a world of difference until next time ');

but i am not dead i am also not horribly injured i realize that it has been many weeks since my last update surely this has caused a number of brooding concerns about my health so i wanted to dispel any wild rumors circulating around it was no malady or injury that kept me from updating my blog no it was negligence negligence brought on by the folly and whimsical nature of summer but as autumn arrives follies must be put aside i would feel remiss however if i didn t keep my beloved followers informed of all my summer adventures my visit to massachusetts was a fulfilling one with 7 aunts 2 uncles and a myriad of cousins and nephews i was certainly kept busy while i chiefly stayed in scituate a charming little harbor town i had the pleasure of traveling all over the state visiting boston was pleasant at usual despite the awful heat that hung over the city i got to take a cruise around the boston harbor and eat delicious veal in the dimly lit cellar of some authentic italian restaurant on the north end but it wouldn t be a trip to boston without some dejecting experience with public transit on my last day in the city i plotted out a visit to the harvard museum of natural history using the city s bus system to ensure that i wouldn t have any issues getting there i left and started walking to the first bus stop 30 minutes early it was hot 94 f at the sun s apogee and i was drenched in sweat within the five minutes of stepping outside i got to the bus stop twenty minutes early the sun s merciless rays causing me to regret the mix of anticipation and apprehension that had convinced me it was wise to leave myself plenty of time to catch the bus it is the same electric feeling i experience before embarking on any journey requiring the use of public transportation bus numbers and times and directions the same numbers circulate through my mind i switch back and forth between leaning against a wall and peering down the street to see if the bus is in sight i increasingly choosing the latter as the bus s arrival time grew nearer finally a few minutes late i make out my bus stopped at a light a few blocks away cash in hand i eagerly step forward to the sign indicating that this was in fact a bus stop for bus 34 so imagine my surprise as the bus drives right past me and my sign and across the nearby intersection stopping on the curb alongside a sign identical to the one i stood next to i began sprinting across the intersection just as the light turned yellow but this was one of those enormous crosswalks that offers pedestrians half a minute to make it across i only managed to make it to the median before the light turned red i was forced to watch helplessly from the middle of the road as people trickle off the bus a few people get on the doors swing shut and my bus drives away thus ended any chance of me visiting the museum this year i walked home feeling cross opting to sulk on the couch and watch keeping up with the kardashians for the rest of the afternoon on the bright side my anticipation for next year s visit to the museum will make its eventual completion all the more satisfying cape cod was also very beautiful it s a very unique environment one without any sort of alternative in my hometown of california that s notable because california is home to practically every landscape the u s has to offer cape cod s charm comes from the diverse ecosystems it supports ranging from highlands to dunes meadows to salt marshes massachusetts s peninsula is full of biodiversity that all its visitors appreciate i stayed with my childhood friend koby at his family s cape house for three days he was working on the cape over the summer at a outdoor ropes course so i had a lot of time to myself during the mornings afternoons over the course of my stay here i finished reading pride and prejudice a personal favorite of mine seated on a bench centered in the house s colorful garden i also had the pleasure of visiting the cape cod museum of natural history and attending one of its nature walks although this certainly was not the harvard museum i mentioned before its whale exhibit was interesting and trails were beautiful and extensive and i was able to satiate my urge to visit some a natural history museum while in massachusetts an urge i know all americans struggle with i returned to san jose on july 22nd spending a week at home before leaving for another mini vacation my father little sister ally and i drove down to long beach to catch a ferry to santa catalina my older sister molly had acquired a summer job on the island driving buses this isn t the first time her bus driving skills have offered her the opportunity to work on an island last summer she drove buses on martha s vineyard cape cod s very own island getaway i figure next year she ll be driving buses in the bahamas santa catalina is absolutely incredible eighty percent of the island is a preserved by the santa catalina island conservancy so the island really has just two populated towns avalon and two harbors my sister stayed in avalon the island company the entity which imported the workforce for the island s tourist attractions housed all of its employees in a comfortable apartment complex nicknamed monkeytown for dirt cheap rent tourist attractions include bus tours of the island s interior the island s zip line course and the beaches with their various bars and restaurants my father and younger sister stayed two days but i chose to stay with my sister for the remainder of the week i slept with her at monkeytown in the backyard of the male employees complex a few of the guys there are rugged outdoorsish types and one of them had a hammock struck up in back i slept in his hammock every night waking up each morning enamored by the island and its beauty every morning i would wake up to the sun painting the face of the adjacent mountainside each day i d get dressed and walk to town to grab a coffee once inn town i d walk to some benches and read on the oceanfront for an hour or so some days i d treat myself after reading and grab breakfast at this nice little cafe granted everything on the island is expensive but i decided to embrace the vacation spirit and spend shamelessly to the injury of my car fund i absolutely fell in love with the island and was very sad to leave it i definitely have to visit again at some point in my life i ferried back to long beach at 7 30 on a friday morning back on the north american continent i bused my way to la union station and hopped on a train to oceanside with the intention of visiting a good friend living further south there i hung around a local coffee shop and waited a few hours for my bus my bus arrives and takes me to temecula ca my destination my buddy steve is waiting for me at the bus stop we head back to his place where i proceed to pass out after inhaling some dinner public transit is exhausting temecula is admittedly less glamorous than santa catalina but i had a good time seeing my buddy steve after nine months apart we spent the weekend playing video games and hanging out poolside two of the few decent things to do in that town monday morning i began my long journey home busing from temecula back to oceanside and hopping on a train from there to santa barbara my friend tommy picks me up from the station monday evening takes me back to his place and we spend the evening relaxing tuesday afternoon and i resume my journey tommy takes me to the transit center where i hop on a spacious bus headed to san fransisco the bus stops in san jose after 6 hours and my dad is waiting at the station he drops me off at home where i pass out drained from the last two days of travel since returning from my travels i ve been transitioning back to a lifestyle geared toward productivity no upcoming trips to look forward to significantly less free time and the looming responsibilities i ll have once i start college late september while i will always appreciate periods of time where i have less responsibilities i thrive with structure without responsibilities it is easy for one to fall into apathy but amidst school work and working on bettering myself there is no room for apathy my attention is primarily fixed on continuing to learn about hone my skills with craft and twig but i also have begun learning about version control and git sometimes it feels like with each new software or language i attempt to add to my arsenal ten other concepts must first be mastered i recently ran into this experience while working on a git basics course on laracasts com while i actually enjoy working in a command line interface i began to stumble as the course instructor introduced the dependency manager composer and the installation of packages no matter what i tried i couldn t produce the same output as the instructor it s frustrating for me when i can t figure something out right away but eventually my struggles paid off when i finally worked out the problem the shell configuration in my system was all screwed up thanks to my having ignorantly fiddled with my system s programs back when i first began working with the cli i consequently reconfigured my default programs and was able to continue the git course this accomplishment was not an important one but a small victory as i continue to grow and develop my skills and knowledge i must remember to celebrate all victories be them big or small daunting as web development and its intricacies may at times seem persistence discipline and a little bit of optimism make a world of difference until next time ');
